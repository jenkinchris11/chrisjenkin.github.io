          <h2>Time Limitations
         As i was running short on time i was only able to have three people take the heuristic evaluation and 10 people to fill in the surveys,
         in retrospect i would have created the Evaluation and survey earlier and would have sourced more people to take the surveys and evaluation,
         doing so would have given more results and other opinions.

         Conclusion <br>
           The main problems that were pointed out by the users were that the UI was too big and was taking over the screen such as
           the health UI which most users thought were too big, to make improvements to this part of the UI i would make the health UI smaller,
           Another problem was that there was no instructions or a controller screen to improve on this i would add an instructions screen and a controller layout screen to the main menu and pause menu.
           More problems were encountered in the surveys such as the main menu being too big as the buttons on the main menu are quite large, 
           to improve this element of the UI i would make the buttons smaller and change the look of the buttons, 
           another problem was encountered when the user was asked is character damage icon too big most users gave an answer of yes as seen in the graph in <a href="https://jenkinchris11.github.io/chrisjenkin.github.io/results.html">Results.</a>
           To improve the charcter damage UI i would change the icon and make it smaller.
